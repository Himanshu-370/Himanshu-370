### A little about me... <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/VgCDAzcKvsR6OM0uWg/giphy.gif" width="50">

I build scalable software systems with a strong focus on backend engineering, reliability, and performance. My work centers on designing APIs, improving system visibility through dashboards, and automating workflows to eliminate manual effort. I care deeply about clean architecture, testable code, and maintainable systems, and I take pride in shipping features end-to-end in production environments.

My core strength is backend development, with full-stack experience when it adds real value to the product. I enjoy working on distributed systems and increasingly explore applied AI for automation, particularly where it saves engineering time and improves developer productivity. I learn quickly in unfamiliar domains and adapt well to fast-moving startup environments that demand ownership and clear impact.

I enjoy collaborating with teams and I’m driven by building useful systems that solve real problems at scale.
